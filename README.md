# Hr_Analysis_PowerBI
**Project Description:**
  Our mission is to create a comprehensive HR Dashboard dedicated to analyzing and addressing attrition within our organization. In response to your request, we are embarking on a data-driven journey to provide valuable insights that will empower our decision-making process.

**Project Situation:**
  The foundation of this project relies on the dataset at our disposal. To ensure that our insights are both accurate and actionable, we will carry out meticulous data cleaning and transformation. This process will involve the utilization of Power Query, which will serve as the engine for cleansing and structuring the data to meet our needs.

**Insights Needed:**
  **Employee Distance Categorization:**
      We will categorize employee distances from their home locations into three distinct groups - "Far-away," "Far," and "Very-        far." This categorization will help us understand the geographical distribution of our workforce and its impact on attrition.
  
  **Work Years Grouping:**
    We will segment employees based on their work years, creating groups with intervals of 10 years. This approach will allow us to assess attrition trends across different career stages and identify potential areas of concern.
  
  **Job Satisfaction Transformation:**
    To enhance readability and interpretation, we will transform the job satisfaction ratings (currently denoted by numbers 1 to 4) into a more user-friendly format. This transformation will make it easier to gauge employee satisfaction levels and their correlation with attrition.
  
  **Age-Bucket Creation:** 
    We will establish age-buckets for employees, facilitating an age-based analysis of attrition. These buckets will help us identify any age-related patterns in employee turnover.
  
  **Necessary KPIs:** 
    The heart of our HR Dashboard will be a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) meticulously chosen to provide a holistic view of attrition within our organization. These KPIs will guide our decision-making and serve as a foundation for actionable insights.

By creating this HR Dashboard, we aim to equip our organization with a powerful tool for understanding and managing attrition. The insights generated will enable us to make informed decisions, improve employee retention, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce. Our commitment is to turn data into valuable knowledge, driving positive change within the organization.
